NexusVue Configs Currently Valid For Necrobot Version - 0.8.5

Changelog: 

Removing "UseSnipeLocationServer", this configuration does however work perfectly with this and i'd advise that you setup Location Feeder located over at https://github.com/drz44/DrZ-Configs/blob/master/PogoLocationFeeder%20GUI%20v0.1.6.zip

These configs are modified versions of existing configs which have been made redundant from Necrobot updates.
These are maintained and updated in the absence of original config writers. 
Upon the return of a an original config owner / update, this repo will not update.

The configs used on this repository are originally sourced over at the DrZ github - https://github.com/drz44/
